Unlike most alarm apps, MultiAlarm doesn’t force you to choose between “snooze” and “dismiss” when you've just woken up and all you want is to shut down that annoying ringing thing. It's not possible to turn off all the alarms accidentally when you try to dismiss ringing alarm. Alarms simply ring according to schedule until you turn them off from the main menu.

Minimum Android SDK version: 23 (6.0).
